# NORMALIZED RANDOM MEAURES WITH INTERACTING ATOMS 

Code to reproduce the plots in the paper by Mario Beraha, Raffaele Argiento, Federico Camerlenghi, and Alessandra Guglielmi.

To reproduce Figure 1, use the notebook `Prior Simulation.ipynb`

To reproduce Figure 2, use the notebook `SNCP Simulation.ipynb`

The files `state.py` and `algorithm.py` contain the source code to perform posterior infrence with Shot-Noise Cox Process mixture models.
